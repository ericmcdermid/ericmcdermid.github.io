### About
I completed a **PhD in Computing Science** at the University of Glasgow in 2011, where I was fully funded by an **EPSRC research grant**.  Throughout the mid 2000s to the mid 2010s I published **~20 papers** in the areas of algorithms, computational complexity, and graph theory.

I then spent some time working in industry, and after 11+ years as **Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Apple** I left to return to research and academic pursuits!

I am currently an **MA candidate in Old Testament** at Columbia Theological Seminary (expected May 2026).  Under the supervision of William P. Brown I study the application of **algorithmic criticism**, a subfield of the **digital humanities**, to the dialogical interpretation of the Psalms and other biblical texts.  I am particularly interested in the careful, responsible application of computational / AI techniques to biblical texts that arm interpreters with **human-understandable, actionable insights**.
