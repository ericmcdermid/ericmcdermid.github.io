### Abstract  
The goal of a hermeneutics of dialogue is to explore a text’s possible meaning
in relation to other texts. Such work has been undertaken in the study of
the Psalms through the identification of so-called “twin psalms” or 
pairs of psalms that exhibit significant linguistic, thematic, or structural
parallels.  

This work generalizes the idea of “twin” / dialogical pairs of psalms to
that of a dialogical network: a graph where nodes are individual Psalms and
edges represent a relationship of statistically outlying intertextuality. We
identify this dialogical network through an innovative application of classical
natural language processing and graph-theoretical techniques to the Hebrew
text.  

This dialogical network shapes our reading of groups of Psalms beyond
what the analysis of twin / paired psalms enables. We demonstrate this
hermeneutical shaping by selecting one sub-network and show how it recasts
our understanding of the move from the “disorientation” of Psalm 79 to the
“new orientation” of Psalm 100 through the further intertextual connection
to Psalms 96 and 98 and the themes of universal justice and reconciliation
found therein.  

Our work serves as a case study in algorithmic criticism and speaks to
some of the methodological questions faced by the digital humanities. On
the one hand, we leverage computational analysis to reveal a structure that
is beyond a human’s manual capabilities of discovery. On the other hand,
the approach is not black-box, and the human remains in the interpretive
driver’s seat by analyzing the dialogical network and using it to hone their
readings.
